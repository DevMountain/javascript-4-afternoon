# Project Summary

In this project, we'll provide practice JavaScript problems to help you better understand `closures` and `constructors`.

## Setup

* `Fork` this repository.
* `Clone` your fork.
* Open `./index.html` with your browser.

## Directions

Complete all of the activities inside of `closures.js` and `constructors.js`. Use their respective `html` files to see if you can make all the tests pass. Remember to commit and push your code often. Good luck!

## Tips and Tricks

One of the biggest tools at the developer's disposal is the browser's built-in debugger. To use it, open `./index.html` with your browser. Another great tool for small and isolated pieces of code is <a href="http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#">Pyton Tutor</a>. Just make sure to change the code to `JavaScript ES6`.

## Contributions

If you see a problem or a typo, please fork, make the necessary changes, and create a pull request so we can review your changes and merge them into the master repo and branch.
